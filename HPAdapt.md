# Bivalent heat pump/boiler operation with fully adaptive supply temperature

## Introduction
The APAdapt calculator is designed to generate proposals for the heat supply of existing building when a gas boiler needs replacement that currently takes over the full heat supply of the building. The focus of the concept calculated is the implementation of a heat pump while maintaining existing heat radiators in the building combined with a highly adaptive supply temperature of the heat pump.

## Parameters

### Estimated savings after basic renovation
When a new heat supply system is introduced into the building this is a very good time to improve the building insulation at the same time allowing to reduce the installed power of the supply system. Even if a full refurbishment of the buidling envelope is not feasible at this point at least the most economical improvements should be considered. This is the percentage of energy consumed before the refurbishment estimated to be saved by improvements of the building envelope.

### Known or estimated warm drinking water consumption
Warm drinking water consumption per year in m3.

## Software background
The calculator uses the [Spreadsheet2Portal](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/Spreadsheet2Portal.md) concept.
Note: The example spreadsheets HPAdapt.ods and HPAdapt.xlsm will be provided soon.
