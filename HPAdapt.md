# Bivalent heat pump/boiler operation with fully adaptive supply temperature

## Introduction
The APAdapt calculator is designed to generate proposals for the heat
supply of existing building when a gas boiler needs replacement that
currently takes over the full heat supply of the building. The focus of
the concept calculated is the implementation of a heat pump while
maintaining existing heat radiators in the building combined with a
highly adaptive supply temperature of the heat pump.  [...]

## Data
[`HPAdaptData`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/hpadapt/HPAdaptData.java)  

### Default room height in building
`roomHeight`  
Can be overridden by heights set for individual rooms.  If a room has no
individual height defined, this height will be used.

### Estimated savings after basic renovation
`savingsAfterBasicRenovation`  
When a new heat supply system is introduced into the building this is a
very good time to improve the building insulation at the same time
allowing to reduce the installed power of the supply system. Even if a
full refurbishment of the building envelope is not feasible at this
point at least the most economical improvements should be considered.
This is the percentage of energy consumed before the refurbishment
estimated to be saved by improvements of the building envelope.

### Known or estimated warm drinking water consumption
`wwConsumption`  
Warm drinking water consumption per year in m³.


### Estimated warm water energy loss from storage, circulation at current temperature in heated areas
`wwLossHeatedAreas`  
The losses in the warm drinking water provision usually partially contribute the the building heating and partially directly go to the outside of the building. This value estimates the relation of losses generated by warm water provision to the warm water energy demand (the value is based on the real demand, not on the overall energy input into warm water provision including losses). This is due to the fact that the calculator estimates the real energy demand based on the warm water consumption, not on the gas energy consumption, which usually is not divided between heating and warm water supply.
