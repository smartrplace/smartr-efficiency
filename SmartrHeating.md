# SmartrHeating energy solutions calculator

## Introduction
The SmartrHeating calculator is designed to generate proposals for cost-efficient automated heating control for all rooms in a building using radio-controlled thermostats and a demand-oriented heating scheme.

## Parameters
[`SmartrHeatingParams`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/smartrheating/SmartrHeatingParams.java) 

### Warm water supply temperature
`wwSupplyTemp`  
Supply temperature of cold water coming into the building (before heating up to warm drinking water)


## Data
[`SmartrHeatingData`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/smartrHeating/SmartrHeatingData.java)  

### Known or estimated warm drinking water consumption
`wwConsumption`  
Warm drinking water consumption per year in mÂ³.


### Estimated warm water energy loss from storage, circulation at current temperature in heated areas
`wwLossHeatedAreas`  
The losses in the warm drinking water provision usually partially contribute the the building heating and partially directly go to the outside of the building. This value estimates the relation of losses generated by warm water provision to the warm water energy demand (the value is based on the real demand, not on the overall energy input into warm water provision including losses). This is due to the fact that the calculator estimates the real energy demand based on the warm water consumption, not on the gas energy consumption, which usually is not divided between heating and warm water supply.

### Warm water energy loss in unheated areas
`wwLossUnheatedAreas`  

### Warm water temperature
`wwTemp`  

## Results
[`SmartrHeatingResult`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/smartrheating/SmartrHeatingResult.java)  

### Warm water energy (pre-renovation) (kWh)
`wwEnergyPreRenovation`  

### Heating energy (pre-renovation) (kWh)
`heatingEnergyPreRenovation`  


## Software background
The calculator uses the [Spreadsheet2Portal](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/Spreadsheet2Portal.md) concept.
Note: Example spreadsheets will be provided soon.
