# SmartrHeating energy solutions calculator

## Introduction
The SmartrHeating calculator is designed to generate proposals for cost-efficient automated heating control for all rooms in a building using radio-controlled thermostats and a demand-oriented heating scheme.

## Parameters
[`SmartrHeatingParams`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/smartrheating/SmartrHeatingParams.java) 

### Cold water supply temperature
`wwSupplyTemp`  
Supply temperature of cold water coming into the building (before heating up to warm drinking water)

### Working hours of customer / building owner
`hoursOfCustomerBase`, `hoursOfCustomerPerRoom`
Own working hours of customer for project implementation:  The value is calculated by the base value, which applies to all projects plus the hours for the implementation in the rooms. The project setup currently assumes that the installation of thermostats is performed by Smartrplace, but the customer leads the Smartrplace installation team through the building and enables/helps to reach each radiator. Window sensors are assumed to be installed by the customer after a training for installation. The extent of customer participation in installation and configuration shall be made more flexible in the calculator in the future. 

## Data
[`SmartrHeatingData`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/smartrHeating/SmartrHeatingData.java)  

### Warm water supply included (boolean)
`wwIsContained`
If true the primary energy consumption (e.g. gas, oil or electricity for a heat pump) for the generation of warm drinking water is contained in the overall heating energy consumption value
and the heating energy bills. Otherwise warm drinking water generation is performed separately in the building, e.g. via direct electricity warm water generation.

## Warm drinking water consumption
`wwConsumption`
Warm drinking water consumption in m3/year. In the future an estimation based on heating bills including warm water shall be possible like the estimation of the total heating input energy. It shall also be possible to estimate the warm water consumption based on the type of the building and the number of users/inhabitants, although such estimation come with a high uncertainty. This volume is the amount of warm drinking water consumed with the [supply temperature](SmartrHeating#wwsupplyTemp) and not the total amount of warm water consumed from cranes, which is usually partially mixed with cold water.

### Warm water temperature
`wwTemp`

### Estimated warm water energy loss from storage, circulation at current temperature in heated areas
`wwLossHeatedAreas`  
The losses in the warm drinking water provision usually partially contribute the the building heating and partially directly go to the outside of the building. This value estimates the relation of losses generated by warm water provision to the warm water energy demand (the value is based on the real demand, not on the overall energy input into warm water provision including losses). This is due to the fact that the calculator estimates the real energy demand based on the warm water consumption, not on the gas energy consumption, which usually is not divided between heating and warm water supply. These losses contribute to the building heating during the heating period, but are relevant losses during the non-heating period.<br>
At the current stage of implementation the losses are assumed to be constant during the entire year.

### Warm water energy loss in unheated areas
`wwLossUnheatedAreas`  
See [Loss to heated areas](SmartrHeating.md#wwLossHeatedAreas). In contrast to the linked element this is the relation of losses going into unheated areas, which are relevant energy losses during heating and non-heating period.


## Results
[`SmartrHeatingResult`](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/smartr-heating-server/src/main/java/extensionmodel/smarteff/smartrheating/SmartrHeatingResult.java)  

### Warm water energy (pre-renovation) (kWh)
`wwEnergyPreRenovation`  

### Heating energy (pre-renovation) (kWh)
`heatingEnergyPreRenovation`  


## Software background
The calculator uses the [Spreadsheet2Portal](https://github.com/smartrplace/smartr-efficiency/blob/master/Spreadsheet2Portal.md) concept.
Note: Example spreadsheets will be provided soon.
